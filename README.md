## What is this repo for?
#### Probably not for you...
This repository contains a series of mini-projects and tools I am building in C++ as I work towards becoming a better developer. This repo exists for my learning, but it can help with somone elses learning too. 

Currently, dependencies for the entire repo so far include (using each of their respective latest versions at the time of commits):
- C++ Compiler (g++)
- Python
- cpp Standard Library (for basic operations and containers)
- xtensor (for numerical computing)
