This repository contains a series of mini-projects and tools I am building in C++ as I work towards developing an options pricer using Monte Carlo simulations and european options pricing.

Currently, dependencies include (using each of their respective latest versions at the time of commits):
- C++ Compiler (g++/clang++)
- Python
- Standard Library (for basic operations and containers)
- xtensor (for numerical computing)
