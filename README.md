## What is this repo for?
#### Probably not for you...
This repository contains a series of mini-projects and tools I am building in C++ as I work towards developing an options pricer using Monte Carlo simulations and european options pricing. This repo exists for my learning, but I'm hoping it can help with somone elses learning too.

Currently, dependencies include (using each of their respective latest versions at the time of commits):
- C++ Compiler (g++/clang++)
- Python
- Standard Library (for basic operations and containers)
- xtensor (for numerical computing)


## RoadMap 
As I progress towards the options pricer, the following steps outline the roadmap of the projects:

1. Messing with C++ and Random Numbers
2. GBM Simulator 
3. (more mini projects to mess around with will be added here before options pricer)

4. Initial Monte Carlo Option Pricer
  - Implement a basic Monte Carlo simulation for European options pricing.

5. Improvements to Options Pricer
- Implement multi-threading for faster simulations. Maybe research lock-free programming but we'll see.
- Optimize performance for large simulations.
- Testing and Validation
- Test the pricer against known benchmarks.
